Really? You want to keep Javascript off your browsing experience?
Firefox, in the new releases, even don't have a setting to disable
Javascript without installing a plugin.

The iliad framework can also degrade to a non ajax version of your
application without loosing any functionality. To enable this
behaviour you must evaluate this code in a new workspace:

{% highlight smalltalk %}
ILAnchorElement useAjaxOnlyForActions: nil
{% endhighlight %}

Now disable Javascript in your browser and see your application
working application without browser. This is part of the Iliad
goodness!
