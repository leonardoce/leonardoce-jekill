Despite being an avid Emacs user, I usually start Emacs with a GUI
interface. I used to start Emacs inside a terminal only when working
on another computer using ssh.

Today I had 10 minutes of free time and I wondered if I could get
Emacs themes working on my terminal.

A few Google searches and Stackoverflow helped me to find the
solution:

* use a 256-colors supporting terminal;
* set the `TERM` environment variable with the right value.

{% highlight sh %}
export TERM=xterm-256color
{% endhighlight %}

With this settings you can use your emacs theme (if it supports
256-color mode) in the console.
